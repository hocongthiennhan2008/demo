        <h1>What Is Climate Change?</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures
            and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes
            in the sun's activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since
            the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change,
            primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act
            like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat
            and raising temperatures.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change
            include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using
            gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building,
            for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can
            also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas
            operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy,
            industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use
            are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.

        <h2>Humans are responsible for global warming</h2>

        <p>
            Climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible
            for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years.
            Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing
            greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at
            any time in at least the last two thousand years.
        </p>

        <p>
            The average temperature of the Earth's surface is now about
            1.42°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s—prior to the
            industrial revolution—and warmer than at any time in the last
            100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest
            on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer
            than any previous decade since 1850.
        </p>

            Many people think that climate change mainly means warmer
            temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of
            the story. Because the Earth is a system where everything is
            connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.

        <p>
            The consequences of climate change include, among others, intense
            droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding,
            melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.

        <h2>People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways</h2>

        <p>
            Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing,
            safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts,
            such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries.
            Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the
            point where entire communities have had to relocate, while protracted droughts
            are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people
            displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.
        </p>

        <h2>Every increase in global warming matters</h2>

        <p>
            In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government
            reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more
            than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain
            a liveable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to up to 2.8°C
            of warming by the end of the century.
        </p>

        <p>
            The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world
            and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others.
            The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India,
            the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Indonesia) together
            account for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions.
            By contrast, the 45 least developed countries contribute only 3 per cent
            of global greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more
            of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.
        </p>

        <h2>We face a huge challenge but already know many solutions</h2>

        <p>
            Many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving
            our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks
            and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals,
            the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.
            Three broad categories of action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate
            impacts and financing required adjustments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will
            reduce the emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a
            growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050,
            emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Achieving this
            means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas: production and consumption
            of all fossil fuels need to be cut by at least 30 per cent by 2030 in order to
            prevent catastrophic levels of climate change.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/climatechange10.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

        <p>
            Adapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods,
            infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely
            in the future. Adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now
            for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards.
            The rate of return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance,
            save lives and property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.
        </p>

        <h2>We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the future</h2>

        <p>
            Climate action requires significant financial investments by governments and
            businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step
            is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt
            and move towards greener economies.
